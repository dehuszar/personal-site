No1 Cooperative was a collaboration between Essential Forms, Inc., DBLDUTCH, Inc., and various multi-media partners in the Chicago area. We built custom CMS applications and full marketing solutions for small businesses and non-profits in the Chicago-land area during the dawn of the modern web.

Here, as the only technical implementer, I had to hone my skills at all levels of the stack; from front-end to backend, databases and deployment, support and administration.  Working with DBLDUTCH, the sites we delivered had far more beauty, design, and flair than I will ever be able to produce.  All of this was being done alongside the shared work of being out in the community, drumming up new clients and projects, handling accounting and invoicing.  It was probably the single most intense period of learning and growth in my career, and I am intensely proud of the projects we were able to deliver during this time.
