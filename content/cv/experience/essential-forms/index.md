Essential Forms was an IT Consulting business I ran, serving the needs of small businesses and non-profits in the Chicago area.  It was the place where I really got to build out my technical skills around (then) emerging web technologies.  EF was the gateway drug for me to be able to wade into the murky challenges of different businesses, teaching me how to interview clients to better understand the root of their concern, research, plan, execute, and demonstrate the value of software-driven technical solutions.
