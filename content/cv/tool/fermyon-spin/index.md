I am very intrigued by the promises of WASM as a backend technology. Being closer to the metal and more securely sandboxed than your traditional docker process, the ability to compile components written in a heterogeneous set of source languages which can all be compiled down to a portable binary which can then be bin-packed more densely than your average service is very exciting.

In addition to having its own Nomad runtime, meaning I can run WASM components on my homelab cluster, Fermyon's free-tier managed offering has been a lot of fun to play with. I currently have a Rust-based side-project in progress using the platform, and I am excited to see where it goes.
