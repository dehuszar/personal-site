When I started building this site, I started out using Hugo; mostly due to a desire to learn Golang, and giving myself opportunity to do so by using tools which can be extended with some light golang chops. As one does though, I bounced around between a bunch of other technologies and platforms, a few JavaScript site builders and backend tools. But once I started getting deep into HTMX, and became more firm in my desire to reduce complexity, dependencies, and build processes, Hugo called to me again and has been a solid space to develop this site.

It boasts an easy-peasy development environment, and a robust extensible way to create custom content types, rich taxonomies and tags, and a flexible templating system to render out all the pages, views, lists, and feeds you could ask for. And it's darned fast.
