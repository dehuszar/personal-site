I've spent the last year leveling up on Github Actions. I've built a few CI/CD pipelines for my personal projects and for my employer. Having a few years maintaining a Gitlab CI workflow for several repos, GitHub Actions takes a lot of the instance configuration, and workload isolation concerns of your typical CI/CD pipeline and simmers them down into cleaner abstractions, and fairly straight-forward set of yaml configurations.

It's not perfect; it can be hard to test, the marketplace is a bit of a mess, and the documentation is a bit scattered, but for something that is available via a fairly generous free tier, it's hard to beat.
