My name is Sam, and I like to tinker with things. I'm a software engineer by trade, but in my ever-diminishing spare time I'm also a writer, a musician, and a maker of things--whether 3d printed, or built out of wood.  I'm also a very fortunate and grateful father and husband.

I unwind from the chair-bound life by doing yoga and practicing karate with my son.  Our family, likes to go canoeing, camping and hiking.

I hope to write about some of those things here as time allows.
