After a long journey trying to figure out what kind of community and culture I most belonged to, I made my way to Seattle Washington.  It was a beautiful city, campus, and culture, and I thrived here.

I completed my degree in English, and intended to get a minor in theater, but after being in college for over 6 years, I was ready to move on.  Theater has always lived on in my heart and has helped me in my career.  I can also read a mean bed time story.

The English degree has helped me in the tech space in a variety of unexpected ways.  First, conveying technically dense and complicated concepts is really hard.  Particularly when discussing large systems, you have to be able to describe both the larger whole as well as its parts.  My degree has helped me refine and clarify how I talk about tech, whether to fellow engineer, or other colleagues whose eyes begin to glaze over at the first mention of microservice architectures.
