Shark Week, but for schools.  I worked as a front-end developer for Discovery Education, upgrading older sub-sites and workflows to use more modern tooling, which at the time was Backbone.  One of the more fun challenges tackled here was around figuring out how to introduce new site components using (again, at the time) the latest version of the Bootstrap CSS library alongside a global header which lived on each page of the entire site which used an older version.  We came up with a clever way to use the LESS CSS pre-processor to dynamically inject only the classes we needed to support the new components, leading to a very lean manifest.

I went on to write an article about the strategy, which we referred to as [Semantic Remapping](https://medium.com/@dehuszar/semantic-remapping-with-css-pre-processors-906ba1a9910c).
