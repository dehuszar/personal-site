I worked at Kaplan for about a year an a half, working on the "Qualified" project.  It's goal was to be a tool for helping job seekers identify educational courses and resources to fill knowledge gaps that would need to be addressed given their career goals.

Here, working with a wonderful team, I learned about [EmberJS](/cv/tool/ember), had my first taste of using AWS's EC2, the MVC design pattern, and a whole lot more.
