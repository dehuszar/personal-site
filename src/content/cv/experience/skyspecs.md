SkySpecs delivers fleet management tools for owners and operators of wind farms.  I had the distinct pleasure of being their first web application developer on staff and got to build out the initial product offering; a data portal for delivering automated drone inspections of wind turbines to customers.

As the company grew beyond the size where we could all fit around a single conference table, ownership of the core web application was handled by a very capable group of engineers, and I moved into the realm of cloud engineering, internal developer platforms, and infrastructure design.

I had the opportunity to learn all about AWS and its myriad products, eventually growing beyond the box of LEGOs they provide and into multi-cloud architectures, composing services and workflows using resources from AWS, Cloudflare, HashiCorp's HCP platform, Confluent and Redpanda Data, Grafana Cloud, and Gitlab.
