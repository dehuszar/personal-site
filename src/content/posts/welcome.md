Hello!  So nice of you to drop by.  I wasn't expecting any visitors, but I'm glad you're here.

This is not meant to be a super fashionable blog that seeks to get to the top of Google's search results, or trend on Twitter.  In fact, I am not the biggest fan of what often passes for the modern web, as offered up by our tech-giant overlords.  That doesn't mean I don't love the web, I do!  Very much so.  It is my hope that my love for the internet, the open web, the digital commons, shines through in this site.  I just think it took a few wrong turns a ways back.  I don't offer my work here as a solution for all that ails the internet, but just as one humble reflection of what *I* love about the web.

What you will find here is a series of writings, observations, and creative output, along with my rolling CV.  In fact, this site is a bit of a CV, in and of itself.  If you want to see how I've made it, I have made the repo publicly available on GitHub.  I will have subsequent posts going into detail about how the site is being made, and why.
